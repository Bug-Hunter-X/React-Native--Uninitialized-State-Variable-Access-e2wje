This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens when using functional components with useState hook in React Native.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count + 1}</Text> 
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};
export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, if the component renders before the useState hook has fully initialized `count`, accessing `count + 1` will lead to a runtime error because `count` is initially `undefined`.
